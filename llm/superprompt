I'd like you to make an analysis on certain crypto assets / coins. I will share a bunch of data below that use can use as a base of your analysis.

The goal of the analysis is: determine if the price of this coin can ever come back or not. It is considered mostly dead in the following cases:  

- extremely low liquidity (no-one will buy the coins)
- token address changed / discontinued (only the uninformed will buy coins)
- extreme low trading volume
- being de-listed on exchanges
- developers abandon the project
- social media falls silent about the coin
- etc...

Here is the latest coin data from an API:
