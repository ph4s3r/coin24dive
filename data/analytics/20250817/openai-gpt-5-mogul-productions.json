        "dead_score": 10,
        "analysis": "Verdict: Effectively dead; do not expect a price comeback on the old STARS token.\n\nWhy:\n- Official migration/rebrand: CoinGecko notice states Mogul Productions (STARS) migrated to a new contract (MOGUL). The old contracts (ETH: 0xc55c…13ca, BSC: 0xbd83…f9a) are deprecated. Once a project migrates, teams and liquidity move to the new token; old tickers rarely recover.\n- Vanishing liquidity and volume: 24h volume is single-digit USD on BSC ApeSwap (~$9) and ~$50 (stale/low-trust) on Uniswap V2. LATOKEN shows only ~$5 volume with a 70%+ spread and anomaly flag. This is extreme illiquidity, implying large slippage and difficulty selling.\n- Market cap collapse: ~$5.4k market cap, FDV ~ $7.4k, down ~99.99% from ATH. An 83% daily drop underscores illiquid, abandoned markets.\n- Exchange status: No meaningful CEX listings; activity limited to DEXes and a low-tier exchange with poor market quality. This is consistent with de-listing post-migration.\n- Development/social focus moved: Developer activity shows 0 commits in past 4 weeks for the old repo. Project communications now center on the new token; the old token is not maintained.\n\nImplications:\n- Price comeback on STARS [OLD] is extremely unlikely. Liquidity is too thin, and the team’s incentives are with the new token. Any spikes are likely illiquidity-driven and not sustainable.\n- If you hold the old token, check the official migration post linked in the notice to see if a swap is still possible. Only use official channels; beware of scam “migration” sites.\n\nBottom line: This is a discontinued asset post-migration with negligible liquidity and exchange support. Treat STARS [OLD] as dead; do not expect recovery."
