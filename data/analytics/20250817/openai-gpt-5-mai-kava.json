        "analysis": "Snapshot (from provided feed)\n- Chain/contract: Kava, 0xb84dF10966A5D7E1Ab46d9276F55D57Bd336Afc7 (GeckoTerminal link present)\n- Listings: Only on Equilibre (DEX) with red trust score; no CEX support shown\n- 24h volume: ~$12.6 total across pairs (extremely low)\n- Price: ~$0.12, down ~-96.7% in 24h; also ~-96.7% over 7/14/60 days\n- Pairs: Quoted vs 0xFA9343… “Multichain-bridged USDC (Kava)” – a widely deprecated/compromised bridge asset\n- Market cap: Not tracked (circulating supply reported as 0); FDV ~ $1.22m off an assumed 10m supply\n- Social/dev on this listing: Telegram 1,535; Twitter points to @0xLaoZi (QiDAO). No recent status updates; CG developer stats show no activity (limited signal)\n\nWhy this looks mostly dead on Kava\n1) Liquidity collapse\n- Single DEX venue with tiny, unstable volume (~$12.6/day). Bid/ask spread exists but is meaningless under this illiquidity. Any trade can move price massively, explaining the violent -96% prints and stray highs.\n\n2) Toxic reference asset in the main pair\n- The primary quote is Multichain-bridged USDC on Kava, an asset many ecosystems mark as deprecated after the Multichain collapse. Pricing against a tainted stable undermines confidence and real liquidity.\n\n3) Exchange presence\n- No centralized or reputable DEX listings beyond Equilibre are shown. Effective discoverability and on/off-ramps are absent.\n\n4) Data signals consistent with abandonment on this chain\n- Market cap untracked, zero circulating reported, no status updates, and no observable, current liquidity incentives. Even if the broader MAI/QiDAO project remains alive on other chains, the Kava deployment appears neglected or sunset.\n\n5) Price behavior incompatible with a functioning stablecoin\n- 24h high of ~$3.8 and a current ~$0.12 for a supposed USD-pegged asset signals broken peg and near-zero depth. ATH values in the feed (e.g., $6.94) look like thin-liquidity artifacts, not organic markets.\n\nCan it come back?\n- Only if the team explicitly revives Kava support: migrate away from Multichain assets to reputable stables, re-seed deep liquidity, secure additional exchange listings, and publish clear comms/migration plans. Without a coordinated relaunch, price discovery will remain illusory and the peg unrecoverable on Kava.\n\nBottom line\n- On Kava, MAI trades like an abandoned, illiquid remnant paired to a deprecated stable. Treat as mostly dead on this chain absent a formal revival/migration announcement from QiDAO.\n\nWhat to watch (if you’re still tracking it)\n- Official QiDAO announcements (Discord/Medium/Twitter) specifically about Kava: contract migrations, LP incentives, or deprecation notices\n- Replacement of Multichain-bridged USDC with reputable native/bridged stables and credible TVL\n- New listings beyond a single small DEX and meaningful, sustained daily volume (>$100k with tight spreads for a stablecoin)\n\nRisk note\n- Swapping in such illiquid pools can incur extreme slippage and failed transactions; verify any purported arbitrage or price before interacting."
