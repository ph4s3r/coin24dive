        "dead_score": 9.3,
        "analysis": "Snapshot: price ~$0.0277, market cap ~$36k, FDV ~$43.7k, supply ~1.31M/1.58M (max 1.89M). Down ~-99.99% from ATH; near ATL (+17% off lows). 24h change -90.6% on ~$302 total volume. TVL reported ~$533k (mcap/TVL ~0.07).\n\nLiquidity and trading activity (very weak):\n- Only thin DEX liquidity/pairs visible (Balancer V2, Uniswap V2, Sushi; plus a Bancor V2 pool). No active centralized exchange listings in the provided tickers.\n- 24h volumes per pair are tiny (roughly $250 + $51 + $33), trust score \"yellow\", one pair stale. Bid-ask ~0.6–0.7%. This is extremely illiquid and prone to large slippage/manipulation.\n- A -90% day with such low volume suggests liquidity removal/pool imbalance and very fragile price discovery.\n\nProject/developer/social signals (weak/dormant):\n- Developer data shows 0 commits in last 4 weeks and no repo activity in this snapshot.\n- Community data is sparse (Telegram ~1k users; no Reddit). Links exist (site, Medium, Twitter, Discord), but no activity metrics provided; absence of engagement data plus dev inactivity is a red flag for abandonment/dormancy.\n\nExchanges/delistings:\n- Only DEX pools shown; lack of CEX tickers suggests no centralized exchange presence (whether never listed or delisted). That limits new buyer flow and liquidity.\n\nToken/contract:\n- Contract unchanged (0x8888…c5) and no migration indicated here. While that avoids a known migration risk, many revivals happen via new token/migration; none is visible from this data.\n\nEconomics vs protocol:\n- Reported TVL is much larger than market cap (mcap/TVL ~0.07). Either TVL is stale/not attributable to token value capture, or the governance token no longer accrues value. In either case, it doesn’t translate into bid support.\n\nWhat it would take to “come back”:\n- A credible relaunch: new active team, roadmap, tokenomics overhaul (e.g., value capture), meaningful liquidity injections/incentives, and fresh exchange listings. None of these are evident in the data provided.\n\nVerdict:\n- This looks mostly dead by the criteria: extremely low liquidity and volume, absence of CEX listings, near-silent developer activity, and catastrophic price collapse to near ATL. While illiquidity can produce brief pumps, a sustainable recovery is very unlikely without a full-scale revival effort. Proceed assuming recovery probability is very low."
