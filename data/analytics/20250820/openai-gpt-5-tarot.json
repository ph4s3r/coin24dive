        "analysis": "Verdict: Tarot V1 is effectively obsolete and unlikely to make a sustainable comeback. Any price spikes would likely be illiquidity-driven rather than fundamentals.\n\nWhy it’s mostly dead\n- Official migration: The public notice states TAROT migrated to new contracts with a new token page. That means V1 is deprecated and value/attention has moved to the new token. Old tokens typically lose support and are not intended to recover.\n- Vanishing activity/liquidity: 24h volume ≈ $1.23 total across tracked markets; bid/ask spreads ~1% and tiny pool sizes. This is extremely illiquid and impractical for entry/exit without heavy slippage.\n- Exchange presence: Only small DEX pools (SpookySwap, Velodrome). No meaningful CEX listings; some DEX feeds are stale, indicating pools are being abandoned.\n- Price collapse: Down ~-95.7% in 24h, ~-95.8% 7d, ~-98.3% 1y; market cap ≈ $35k, FDV ≈ $52k against 67.7M circulating—classic profile of a migrated/abandoned token.\n- Dev focus elsewhere: Repo shows no recent commits; migration implies developer attention is on the new contracts/token, not V1.\n- Social/interest: Community metrics are minimal; the notice and new token redirect suggest the conversation moved on from V1.\n\nNotes\n- The TVL figure shown (~$4.94m) is likely protocol-level and does not represent tradable liquidity in the V1 token. The token’s mcap/volume tell the real story for V1.\n\nWhat could change this?\n- Only an explicit, official revival or remapping of value to V1 by the team (highly unlikely post-migration). Otherwise, occasional illiquid pumps are possible but not sustainable.\n\nActionable\n- If you hold V1, check official channels for any migration/claim instructions and deadlines. Avoid buying V1; if you want exposure to the project, use the currently supported token/contracts as per the official links."
