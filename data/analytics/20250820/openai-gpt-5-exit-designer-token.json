        "dead_score": 8.5,
        "analysis": "Verdict: mostly dead from a market-liquidity/attention standpoint. A sustainable comeback to prior highs looks very unlikely without a major turnaround.\n\nKey signals\n- Liquidity/volume: 24h volume ~ $1.8 across listings, with a 75% bid-ask spread on Changelly PRO and a stale PancakeSwap v2 quote. This is functionally illiquid—exiting or entering size at fair prices is difficult.\n- Exchange presence: Only a thin DEX pair (PancakeSwap v2) and a minor CEX (Changelly PRO). No Tier-1 or mid-tier listings, and the CEX ticker is stale with microscopic volume. Discoverability and fresh inflows are minimal.\n- Market structure data: CoinGecko shows circulating supply = 0 and market cap = 0 (untracked), yet FDV screens ~ $600M at ~$0.60. That FDV is a paper figure in the absence of real float and liquidity; price is easily moved by small orders.\n- Price action: -79.6% in 24h and ~-90% from ATH. It also did a round-trip to an ATL in June and then spiked again—behavior consistent with very thin books and episodic pumps rather than organic demand.\n- Developer activity: GitHub exists but shows 0 commits in the last 4 weeks and minimal repo signals (1 fork, 0 stars). Not proof of abandonment, but no visible build velocity.\n- Community/interest: Only 48 CoinGecko watchlists and ~1.9k Telegram members. Social links exist (Twitter/Instagram/TikTok/Discord), but the dataset offers no evidence of strong, ongoing engagement. Attention appears low.\n- Token/contract: Single BSC contract address is consistent; no indication of a rebase or migrated token. However, on-chain liquidity depth is likely tiny given the volumes and spreads.\n\nWhat would need to change to revive it\n- Inject and lock meaningful liquidity on the primary DEX pair(s); add reputable market-making to tighten spreads.\n- Secure additional credible CEX listings with real market depth; keep order books active.\n- Publish verifiable circulating supply and improve transparency on tokenomics, treasury, and liquidity lock status (ideally multisig + time-locked).\n- Ship product traction that drives actual token demand (the luxury marketplace narrative needs on-chain evidence of usage), plus sustained marketing/community growth.\n\nOutlook\n- Without the above, the asset will likely remain illiquid with sporadic pumps and sharp dumps. A durable return toward prior highs is low probability. Treat as very high risk and thinly traded; small orders only if engaging at all, and assume liquidity may vanish at any time."
