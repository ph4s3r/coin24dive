        "analysis": "SWAG is a pure meme token on Ethereum with no real development, no detectable circulating supply on CoinGecko (circulating_supply = 0), and zero on-chain project activity (no GitHub, no commits, no open issues). Community metrics are flat (Reddit 0, Telegram none), and the official website/whitepaper offer only marketing copy without substance.\n\nIt trades only on small venues (Uniswap V2, XT.com, Bilaxy) with combined 24 h volume under ~$200 k and FDV ~$2.3 M, showing minimal liquidity depth (bid/ask spreads 0.6â€“2%). It has already fallen ~91% from its all-time high in November 2024, and social/media attention is effectively dead.\n\nWith no development roadmap, no active community, no exchange support beyond obscure platforms, and no on-chain momentum, a meaningful price rebound is extremely unlikely."
