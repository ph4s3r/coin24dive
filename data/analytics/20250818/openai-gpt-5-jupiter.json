        "dead_score": 9.2,
        "analysis": "Verdict: Mostly dead. Probability of a sustainable comeback is very low; only speculative pumps are plausible.\n\nWhy:\n- Liquidity/volume: Reported 24h volume ≈ $1.7k with DEX-only liquidity on PancakeSwap (BSC) and Uniswap v2 (ETH). Bid/ask spreads ~0.7–0.9% and ticker anomalies indicate extremely shallow pools and unreliable pricing. Any meaningful sell would likely incur heavy slippage.\n- Exchange support: No Tier-1 CEX listings. The only CEX shown is Bilaxy (stale) — a low-tier venue. Effective discoverability and market access are minimal.\n- Price collapse: Down ~99.94% from ATH and ~-92% in the last 24h, with severe declines across 7/14/30/60/200d. To revisit ATH ($0.128999) from ~$0.000079 implies ~1,630x — unrealistic without major, external catalysts.\n- Project/dev activity: Developer data shows zero recent commits and no visible ongoing development. Status updates are empty; community metrics are very small (Telegram ~777). This looks abandoned.\n- Branding confusion and risk flags: Public notice clarifies it’s NOT the Jupiter DEX (Solana) token. This naming collision reduces credibility and exchange appetite. CoinGecko also displays a generic liquidity-risk caution. Two legacy contracts (ETH and BSC) persist, but there’s no sign of an organized migration or upgrade.\n\nWhat would need to change to recover:\n- Verified, revived team with transparent roadmap, code commits, and shipped product.\n- Fresh liquidity injections, larger LPs, and new reputable exchange listings.\n- Clear rebrand to end confusion with Solana’s Jupiter, plus active marketing/community growth.\n\nAbsent the above, the base case is continued illiquidity/drift. If you still hold, assume exit friction. Test small sells for slippage and verify LP depths on-chain. Monitor: contract addresses, LP size changes, any credible team communications, and GitHub activity.\n\nBottom line: This asset meets multiple “dead” criteria (illiquidity, vanishing volume, lack of development, weak listings, brand confusion). A durable comeback is highly unlikely."
