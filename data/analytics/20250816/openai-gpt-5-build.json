        "analysis": "Headline: BUILD looks effectively dead based on liquidity, activity, and price structure. A comeback would require a full-scale relaunch with fresh capital and listings.\n\nWhat the data is saying\n- Liquidity/volume: 24h volume ≈ $216 total across DEX pools; individual pairs show tiny converted volume ($26, $68). This is extremely illiquid and implies large slippage for any meaningful trade.\n- Market cap/momentum: Market cap ≈ $8.6k; FDV ≈ $11.1k; ATH drawdown ≈ -99.96%; multi-timeframe performance: -93% (24h), -97.6% (7d), -97.3% (60d), -96.9% (1y). Price has collapsed across all horizons and remains near lows.\n- Exchange presence: No credible CEX listings. Trading is on RadioShack DEX (trust score red) and a thin PancakeSwap v2 pool. Lack of centralized or reputable DEX liquidity is a major red flag.\n- Token contracts/issuance: Deployed on multiple chains (ETH, BSC, AVAX, Fantom, Polygon, Cronos, Optimism), fragmenting already-thin liquidity. No max supply (infinite), and the contract owner can mint new tokens (explicit warning). This severely undermines token value and investor confidence.\n- Community/developer activity: Telegram users ≈ 69; developer metrics show 0 commits and no public repos. Social links point to RadioShack brand accounts rather than an active, coin-specific community. This suggests practical abandonment.\n- Listings/status: No evidence of recent listings; presence confined to low-trust DEX pools. Being functionally absent from major venues is tantamount to a de facto delisting in market visibility terms.\n\nImplications for a comeback\n- What would be required: significant new liquidity provisioning (deep LPs), credible CEX/solid DEX listings, a transparent team revival (or takeover), removal/renunciation of mint privileges or a hard migration to a fixed-supply contract, clear utility, and active community growth.\n- Probability under current conditions: very low. With near-zero liquidity, minuscule market cap, unlimited mint risk, and dormant socials, organic recovery is unlikely. Any short-term spikes would be prone to pump-and-dump dynamics due to thin books.\n\nVerdict\n- Classification: Mostly dead.\n- Rationale: Extreme and sustained drawdown, negligible volume/liquidity, no active development or community, mintable supply risk, and lack of credible exchange support. Without a formal relaunch/migration and capital injection, a durable price recovery is improbable.\n\nNotes/caveats\n- Data is point-in-time. If a new team announces a migration, renounces minting, injects liquidity, and secures listings, reassess. Otherwise, treat as capital-impaired and illiquid."
