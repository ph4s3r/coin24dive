        "analysis": "Summary: QMALL looks functionally “mostly dead” unless the underlying Qmall Exchange meaningfully revives. The token is down ~99.65% from ATH, experienced an -86.7% crash in the last 24h, and real liquidity/volume are extremely low.\n\nWhat the data says\n- Purpose: Exchange utility token for Qmall Exchange. If the exchange isn’t active/growing, token demand is structurally weak.\n- Price/returns: -99.65% from ATH; -76.9% over 1y; -86.7% in the last 24h. This pattern is consistent with projects that have lost traction or suffered a major confidence shock.\n- Market cap and supply: ~$334k market cap, ~$473k FDV; ~70.7m in circulation of 100m total. No major unlock risk visible, but demand is the key missing piece.\n- Liquidity/volume (critical): 24h total volume ≈ $2,008 across public markets (Uniswap V2 ~$1.4k, PancakeSwap ~$0.6k). The project’s own exchange shows ~$3.9k on QMALL/USDT but flagged as “anomaly” with a 26% bid-ask spread—suggesting unreliable liquidity/volume quality. This meets the “extremely low trading volume/liquidity” criterion.\n- Listings: Only on Uniswap V2 (ETH), PancakeSwap (BSC) and the project’s own Qmall exchange. No meaningful centralized exchange presence; either never achieved or lost broader listings. Very weak market access.\n- Spreads: DEXs show modest spreads (~0.6%), but pools are tiny; the Qmall CEX pairs have double-digit spreads, indicating poor orderbook depth and potential price manipulation risk.\n- Dev/social signals: No GitHub activity; no status updates; Telegram size ~10.8k users but engagement unknown. Links exist (Twitter/Telegram), but dataset shows no recent updates—suggesting low activity. This aligns with “social media falls silent.”\n- Contracts: Addresses exist on BSC, ETH, and Velas. No explicit evidence here of contract migration/discontinuation, but also no fresh development activity.\n\nCan it come back?\n- For a durable recovery, QMALL would need: (1) clear, verifiable revival/growth of Qmall Exchange (users, volumes, revenues), (2) credible new listings and real market-making/liquidity on reputable venues, (3) sustained community/comms and product progress. None of these are visible in the provided data.\n- Thin liquidity means prices can “spike” on tiny flows, but that’s not a sustainable comeback; it’s slippage-driven volatility.\n\nRisks if holding/trading now\n- Exit risk: With ~$2k real 24h volume, offloading even small positions can move price materially.\n- Pricing anomalies: The project’s own exchange shows anomalous prints and very wide spreads—beware false price signals.\n- Further delist/abandonment risk: Already minimal exchange presence and no dev/status activity.\n\nVerdict\n- Dead score: 8.8/10. Not technically extinct (some pools still exist), but by practical measures—liquidity, listings, activity, and price collapse—it is mostly dead. A true comeback looks very unlikely without major, externally verifiable catalysts.\n\nNote: This is not financial advice. If you must interact, use tiny sizes, set strict slippage limits, and assume you may not find exit liquidity."
