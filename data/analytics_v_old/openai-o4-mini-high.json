Market & Liquidity  \n \u2022 Market cap: ~$21 k (rank ~8 740), Fully-Diluted Valuation: ~$47 k  \n \u2022 Only listed on PancakeSwap v2 (no CEX listings)  \n \u2022 24 h volume: ~$70 k (\u22483\u00d7 market cap) \u2013 likely wash trading or single LP activity  \n \u2022 Bid-ask spread ~0.6%; true lock-in liquidity probably under $30 k  \n\n2. Price Action & Volatility  \n \u2022 ATH $0.00003628 (Jun 29, 2024); down ~99.85% to $0.0000000534 today  \n \u2022 \u221275% past 24 h, \u221276% past 7 d, ~\u221299% over 200 d and 1 yr  \n \u2022 Such steep, sustained declines with no bounce indicate exhaustion of speculative demand  \n\n3. Developer & Community Activity  \n \u2022 GitHub: zero forks, zero stars, zero commits in last 4 weeks, no open/closed issues or PRs  \n \u2022 Telegram: ~2 000 users; Reddit/Twitter largely dormant  \n \u2022 No roadmap updates, partnerships or fresh marketing since launch  \n\n4. Contract & Rug-Pull Risk  \n \u2022 Public notice: owner can disable sells, change fees, mint or transfer tokens at will  \n \u2022 Single-developer code, no multi-sig or timelock on contract changes  \n \u2022 High risk of honeypot or exit-scam if owner chooses to drain liquidity  \n\n5. Fundamental Utility & Outlook  \n \u2022 Purely a \u201ccat-meme\u201d token with no DeFi functionality or staking rewards  \n \u2022 No integrations, protocols or real-world use cases to revive demand  \n \u2022 Without major exchange listings, active development or genuine community growth, speculative pumps remain one-off and unsustainable  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven its microscopic market cap, single-DEX listing, virtually zero development, tiny/dormant community and a fully controllable (and thus dangerous) smart contract, CATEX exhibits all hallmarks of a \u201cdead\u201d or dying token. Absent a dramatic shift\u2014new credible developers, third-party audits, exchange listings or genuine utility\u2014its price is unlikely to recover in any meaningful way.",
